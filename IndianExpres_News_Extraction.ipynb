              " '\\nA “timeline” for privatisation of two state-owned banks and one general insurance companies cannot be specified, but the government policy on privatisation will continue, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said Saturday. Addressing the Confederation of Indian Industry’s (CII) National Council in a post-Budget interaction, she said the Budget has been very “simple and straightforward” with a clear path chosen for investing in creation of assets, which have a higher multiplier effect on economic activity and job creation.\\n“The policies which were announced in 2021 are continuing and I’m reiterating them in this Budget. I’m also ensuring that there is stability, there’s continuity and transparency. And privatisation was part of a policy announcement. In fact, it was very specifically an announcement that we want minimum government maximum governance and therefore government will get out of many of these areas and equally open up all the sectors, all the areas for private sector. However, the strategic sectors will be those in which at least a bare minimum presence of the government will be there,” Sitharaman said.\\nAlso Read |States’ capex spend quicker, likely more effective, says Finance Secretary TV Somanathan')"
